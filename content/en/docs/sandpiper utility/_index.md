## Introduction

A Level 1 implementation of Sandpiper means syncing "file-based" data-objects. The `sandpiper` CLI tool supports adding, pulling and listing Level 1 files. This functionality is mostly duplicated by the web-based Admin screens, but a command line interface allows an important alternative for hands-free automation.

## Command Syntax

```
sandpiper [global-options] [add | list | pull | help] [command-options] <arguments>

global-options (also available via [environment variable]):
   --user name, -u name        server login name [SANDPIPER_USER]
   --password value, -p value  user password [SANDPIPER_PASSWORD]
   --config FILE, -c FILE       Load configuration from FILE (default: config.yaml)
                               [SANDPIPER_CONFIG]
   --debug, -d                 provide some debugging information to stdout
   --help, -h                  show general help (default: false)
   --version, -v               print the version (default: false)

commands:
   add      add a file-based grain from a local file
   pull     save file-based grains to the file system
   list     list slices (if not provided) or file-based grains by slice_id or slice_name
   help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command
```

If the password is not provided, you will be prompted for it.

## Configuration file

All commands look for a `config.yml` file in the current directory to determine the sandpiper server address (this can be overridden by the `--config` option or by the SANDPIPER_CONFIG environment variable). 

Here is an example of the config.yml file.

```
command:
  url: http://localhost
  port: 8080
```

## Add File-Based Objects

The `add` command creates a "file" data-object (i.e. grain) and adds it to a slice. This command could be called by an internal PIM, for example, to "publish" completed delivery files. By convention,
all L1 grains have a grain_key of "level-1" and use "z85" encoding (gzip/ascii85).

### Usage

```
sandpiper [global-options] add [command-options] <unzipped-file-to-add>

command-options:
   --slice value, -s value  either a slice_id (uuid) or slice_name (case-insensitive)
   --noprompt               do not prompt before over-writing a grain (default is to prompt)

arguments:
    A single filename (absolute or relative to the command) that should be added to the
    provided slice. The file should in its native format (e.g. .xml, .txt) and should
    *not* be zipped. Compression is performed separately by the add command.

Example:
    export SANDPIPER_USER=user
    export SANDPIPER_PASSWORD=password
    sandpiper add --slicename "aap-brakes" --noprompt acme_brakes_full_2019-12-12.xml
```

This command adds the ACES xml file as a grain as defined by the supplied request body (see below).
  
### Sandpiper API

The following api is used to add an object with the sandpiper add command:

```
POST /v1/grains
```

The request "body" submitted by `sandpiper add` would look like this:

```
{
    "slice_id": "2bea8308-1840-4802-ad38-72b53e31594c",
    "grain_key": "level-1",
    "encoding": "z85"
    "payload": "--gzip/ascii85 encoded data from supplied filename--"
}
```

The response would include the assigned grain "id" (but not the payload). Use the `sandpiper list --full` command to display all information stored.

```
{
  "id": "cb5872d2-6f98-4f23-bd2f-7366b8063523",
  "slice_id": "1b40204a-7acd-4c78-a3c4-0fa95d2f00f6",
  "grain_key": "level-1",
  "source": "acme_brakes_full_2019-12-12.xml",
  "encoding": "z85",
  "payload_len": 2696,
  "created_at": "2020-04-07T15:59:40.5223569-05:00"
}
```

## List File-Based Objects

This command displays slice information or grain information for a slice.

### Usage

```
sandpiper [global-options] list [command-options]

command-options:
   --slice value, -s value  either a slice_id (uuid) or slice_name (case-insensitive)
   --full                   provide full listings (default: false)
   --help, -h               show help (default: false)

    If a slice is not provided, a listing of slices is displayed to stdout.
    If a slice is provided and a valid UUID, it is interpreted as a slice_id.
    If a slice is provided and not a valid UUID, it is interpreted as a slice_name. 

Examples:
    sandpiper -u user -p password list
    sandpiper -u user -p password list --slice 1b40204a-7acd-4c78-a3c4-0fa95d2f00f6
    sandpiper -u user -p password list --full --slice aap-brake-pads
```

## Pull File-Based Objects

The "pull" command is used to retrieve "file" data-objects from a slice in the pool. If a slice is not supplied, it will pull all level-1 grains it finds on the server. Files are always saved in a sub-directory named after the slice it came from.

### Usage

```
sandpiper [global-options] pull [command-options] <output-directory>

command-options:
   --slice value, -s value  either a slice_id (uuid) or slice_name (case-insensitive)
   --help, -h               show help (default: false)

    If a slice is not provided, all level-1 grains are extracted to the local file system.
    If a slice is provided and a valid UUID, it is interpreted as a slice_id.
    If a slice is provided and not a valid UUID, it is interpreted as a slice_name.  

arguments:
   optional output directory (will be created if it doesn't exist)

Examples:
    sandpiper -u user -p password pull --slice 1b40204a-7acd-4c78-a3c4-0fa95d2f00f6
    sandpiper -u user -p password pull --slice "aap-brake-pads" /temp/output
    sandpiper -u uers -p password pull /temp/output

    This last example will create a directory structure under /temp/output with the
    slice name as the parent for each grain pulled:

    /temp/output
        |-- slice1
            |-- grain1
        |-- slice2
            |-- grain2 
```
    
Use forward slashes for the output directory even if on Windows. If an an output directory is not supplied as an argument, the current directory will be used.

The grain `source` field is used as the filename when saving the payload. If this value is empty, the slice-id is used instead.
